## [CPU] Performance Processor Scaling Governor

Intel CPU's reported to be run faster when changed its scaling governor to performance mode. For laptops this may decrease battery life.

**Source:** https://askubuntu.com/questions/1021748/set-cpu-governor-to-performance-in-18-04#comment1820782_1049313

**NOTE:** If you are using a laptop with battery try installing https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/945/cpu-power-manager/ For more information see section [2.10. Gnome Extensions](#210-gnome-extensions)

- Running the following command is enough:

```bash
$ sudo systemctl disable ondemand
```

- Check the CPU governor after reboot:

```bash
$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor
```



## [CPU] Disable Security Mitigations
Reclaim the CPU power back taken from security patches. It's been years and there are no viruses using these exploits.

**Source(s):** https://make-linux-fast-again.com/

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/KnowledgeBase/SpectreAndMeltdown/MitigationControls

https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/b1ltnr/disabling_kernel_cpu_vulnerabilities_mitigations/

- Open grub configuration with `gedit`.

```bash
$ sudo gedit /etc/default/grub
```

- In the editor change this line;

```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"
```

- to this then save:

```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash noibrs noibpb nopti nospectre_v2 nospectre_v1 l1tf=off nospec_store_bypass_disable no_stf_barrier mds=off mitigations=off"
```

- Apply new configuration:

```bash
$ sudo update-grub
```

- After reboot, check vulnerabilities.

```bash
$ grep . /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/*
```

- This command should give output similar to this:

```
/sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/l1tf:Mitigation: PTE Inversion; VMX: vulnerable
/sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/mds:Vulnerable; SMT vulnerable
/sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/meltdown:Vulnerable
/sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spec_store_bypass:Vulnerable
/sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spectre_v1:Mitigation: __user pointer sanitization
/sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spectre_v2:Vulnerable, IBPB: disabled, STIBP: disabled
```


## [RAM] Compressed Memory

If your PC is out of memory or has no extra space for caching, give it a shot!

- Create ZRAM script:

```bash
$ sudo touch /usr/bin/zram.sh
$ sudo chmod 555 /usr/bin/zram.sh
$ sudo nano /usr/bin/zram.sh
```

- Paste the following lines: 
  - Note(1): Modify `ZRAM_MEMORY` according to your PC configuration.
  - Note(2): Change `lz4` to `zstd` to increase compress ratio, but will cost CPU time. Source: https://github.com/facebook/zstd
  - Note(3): Some other scripts on the Internet create zram devices depending on CPU cores, but it is not needed since multiple streams can be set for one single device.

```
##########################
ZRAM_MEMORY=2048
##########################
set -x
CORES=$(nproc --all)
modprobe zram
ZRAM_DEVICE=$(zramctl --find --size "$ZRAM_MEMORY"M --streams $CORES --algorithm lz4)
mkswap $ZRAM_DEVICE
swapon --priority 5 $ZRAM_DEVICE
```

- Set the script run on boot:

```bash
$ sudo nano /etc/rc.local
```

- Paste the following lines:

```
#!/bin/bash
bash /usr/bin/zram.sh &
exit 0
```

- Set `rc.local` as executable:

```bash
$ sudo chmod +x /etc/rc.local
```

- Reboot the PC.

If there is a problem check rc.local service with:

```bash
$ sudo systemctl status rc-local
```


## [GPU] Update On-Board GPU Drivers

Get latest Intel/AMD on-board graphics drivers to support latest features like OpenGL 4.5.

**Source:** https://launchpad.net/~oibaf/+archive/ubuntu/graphics-drivers?field.series_filter=bionic

```bash
# For Ubuntu 18
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:oibaf/graphics-drivers
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install --install-recommends linux-generic-hwe-18.04
$ sudo apt upgrade
$ sudo apt install -f # if it crashes while upgrading
```


## [HDD] Ext4 Mount with noatime Option

Prevent saving file last access times on the hard drive. Reduces disk access thus improving performance.

```bash
$ sudo nano /etc/fstab
```

- Add `noatime` word like shown below:

`UUID=12242bc2-d367-468e-af75-c6a35bd610ca / ext4 errors=remount-ro,noatime 0 1`

- Reboot the PC




## [HDD] Preload

Preload, monitors user activity and caches programs into RAM. Prefer this if you are using HDD. No need for SSD users.

**Source:** https://www.hecticgeek.com/2013/05/using-preload-ubuntu-13-04/

- Install the program with the following command. No further configurations are needed.

```bash
$ sudo apt install preload
```


## [HDD] Manually Cache Folders (browsers, apps, etc.)

Select folders/files to cache into virtual memory to improve user experience when cold boot.

**Source:** https://hoytech.com/vmtouch/

- Install vmtouch and configure files/folders list:

```bash
$ sudo apt install vmtouch
$ sudo touch /etc/vmtouch_list
$ sudo chmod 555 /etc/vmtouch_list
$ sudo nano /etc/vmtouch_list
```

- Make your list like located below: (You need to modify this file according to you needs. These folders will be cached into RAM when PC boot up)

```
/usr/lib/chromium-browser/
/home/salih/.config/chromium/
/usr/share/typora/
/usr/share/discord/
```

- Set to run on boot:

```bash
$ sudo crontab -e
```

- Paste the following line:

```
@reboot /usr/bin/vmtouch -f -t -b /etc/vmtouch_list > /etc/vmtouch_log 2>&1
```

- You can check log file `/etc/vmtouch_log` if there are errors or not.


## [HDD] BFQ Disk Scheduler

**Source(s):** https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=linux-50hdd-io

https://community.chakralinux.org/t/how-to-enable-the-bfq-i-o-scheduler-on-kernel-4-12/6418

- Create a new udev rule:

```bash
$ sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/60-scheduler.rules
```

- Add the lines below:

```
# set cfq scheduler for rotating disks
ACTION=="add|change", KERNEL=="sd[a-z]", ATTR{queue/rotational}=="1", ATTR{queue/scheduler}="bfq"
```

- Update grub file:

```bash
$ sudo udevadm control --reload
$ sudo udevadm trigger
```

- After reboot, test with this command:

```bash
$ cat /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler
```

- The output must be like this:

```
mq-deadline [bfq] none
```

## [HDD] Disable Default Swapfile on Disk

Ubuntu 18.04 comes with a swapfile enabled. In out-of-memory situations this swapfile may only cause system freeze. If you are using Ubuntu with SSD, you should disable swap in that device to slow down disk aging.

- Modify `fstab`:

```bash
$ sudo nano /etc/fstab
```

- Comment out the line which starts with `/swapfile`. The full line should look like this after editing:

```
#/swapfile none swap sw 0 0
```

- Reboot the PC.

## [HDD] Defrag & Optimize Ext4 Partitions

```bash
###############################################
########## VERY IMPORTANT !!! #################
# BOOT PC FROM A UBUNTU IMAGE USB STICK #######
###############################################
$ sudo fsck.ext4 -y -f -v -D /dev/sdX
# Now mount the partition, then run:
$ sudo e4defrag -v /dev/sdX
```



## [NET] Turn Off Wifi Power Save Feature

Speed up wifi performance. Not recommended for laptops in battery mode.

**Source:** https://easylinuxtipsproject.blogspot.com/p/speed-mint.html

- Run following command:

```bash
$ sudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/default-wifi-powersave-on.conf
```

- Change the value to 2. File should be look like this:

```
[connection]
wifi.powersave = 2
```

- Restart computer, then check it with this command. (It must be off)

```bash
$ iwconfig | grep Management
```



## [NET] Faster TCP (BBR, Fast TCP Open)

It is reported that using this algorithm (BBR) developed by Google and Fast TCP Open increases network speed and reduces delay.

**Source(s):** https://gist.github.com/Jamesits/3d6da2d711bd95c53ccd953f99aee748

https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Sysctl#Enable_TCP_Fast_Open

- Modify loaded modules on boot:

```bash
$ sudo nano /etc/modules-load.d/modules.conf
```

- Add the following line:

```
tcp_bbr
```

- Modify system variable configuration file:

```bash
$ sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf
```

- Add the following lines:

```
net.ipv4.tcp_fastopen = 3
net.core.default_qdisc=fq
net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control=bbr
```

- Reboot the PC.
- Test if it is running. This command should output `bbr` as printed.

```bash
$ sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control
```



## [OS] Disable Unnecessary Services

Reduce memory usage on weak systems about ~300Mb. Be careful and do your search before removing any packages.

**Source:** https://prahladyeri.com/blog/2017/09/how-to-trim-your-new-ubuntu-installation-of-extra-fat-and-make-it-faster.html

```bash
# DISABLE UPDATE/UPGRADE SERVICES (If you do it manually and hate upgrade notifications)
$ sudo apt remove unattended-upgrades # Automatic upgrades
$ sudo mv /etc/xdg/autostart/update-notifier.desktop /etc/xdg/autostart/update-notifier.desktop.old # Disable update notifer
$ sudo mv /etc/xdg/autostart/gnome-software-service.desktop /etc/xdg/autostart/gnome-software-service.desktop.old # Disable gnome software updater

# DISABLE PRINTER SERVICES (If you don't use a printer)
sudo systemctl disable cups 
sudo systemctl disable cups-browsed

# DISABLE THESE SERVICES ON OLD/WEAK SYSTEMS
$ sudo apt remove whoopsie # Error Repoting, remove it on weak systems
$ sudo systemctl mask packagekit.service # Disable if you don't use gnome-software
$ sudo systemctl mask geoclue.service # CAUTION: Disable if you don't use Night Light or location services
$ sudo apt remove gnome-software # Software Store. Remove if you don't use it
$ sudo apt remove deja-dup # Automatic backup tool

# DISABLE EVOLUTION/GNOME-ONLINE-ACCOUNTS (Email, calender, contact sync app. Disable it if you don't use it. It uses a lot of memory)
$ sudo apt remove gnome-online-accounts # Gnome online accounts plugins
$ sudo chmod -x /usr/lib/evolution/evolution-calendar-factory
$ sudo chmod -x /usr/lib/evolution/evolution-addressbook-factory
$ sudo chmod -x /usr/lib/evolution/evolution-source-registry
```


## [OS] Remove Snap Apps (and replace with native apps)

Snap is a software packaging and deployment system developed by Canonical for the Linux operating system. With snap we can install programs like in our smart phones. But in my perspective it doesn't work well and background services use memory a lot. So I can recommend removing snap.

```bash
# Remove Snap and its packages:
$ snap remove gnome-3-34-1804 gnome-calculator gnome-characters gnome-logs gnome-system-monitor gtk-common-themes
$ snap remove core18
$ snap remove snapd
$ sudo apt remove snapd

# Install native version of uninstalled packages:
$ sudo apt install gnome-calculator gnome-characters gnome-logs gnome-system-monitor
```
