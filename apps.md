# Applications

## App Installation Sources

### APT

First choice.

### [Apps for GNOME](https://apps.gnome.org/)

### [KDE Applications](https://apps.kde.org/)

### [Flathub](https://flathub.org/home)

Installation of flatpak is needed. See the [Ubuntu Quick Setup](https://flatpak.org/setup/Ubuntu) guide.

### [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/store)

I think this must be the last resort. On the positive side, it comes pre-installed.

### AppImage

### Closed Source
