- Install wondershaper package:

```bash
$ sudo apt install wondershaper
```

- Find your network interface: (For this example my network interface is enp4s0f1)

```bash
$ ifconfig
```

- Limit your bandwidth: (For this example: Download 1024 Kbits / Upload 256 Kbits)

```bash
$ sudo wondershaper enp4s0f1 1024 256
```

(RECOVER) Remove limitations for the adapter:

```bash
$ sudo wondershaper clear enp4s0f1
```
